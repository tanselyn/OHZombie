# Office Hours of the Dead

Starter files for F15P2. This includes:

  * The priority queue header files.
  * The Random Zombie Generator (TM).
  * A `Makefile`.
  * Some example test code. You can compile the test cases with `make alltests`,
    and then run the corresponding tests, such as with `./testAppendixA`.

You can download this repository as a .zip or .tar.gz file by selecting it in
the upper-right corner.

Or you may fork the project and start developing using Git and Gitlab. If you do
so, **ensure that your project is private** (Dashboard > Settings > Visibility
Level) or you face a possible Honor Code violation. Tips:

  * Commit frequently. Whenever you implement a simple feature, even if it's
    buggy, it's probably worth a commit so that you can revert to a clean slate
later if you need to. If you have to, favor committing way too often rather than
not often enough.
  * Push to Gitlab regularly. If you've been committing frequently and your
    computer dies, you'll have a backup.
  * **Make sure your project is private**. Internal is *not* acceptable; it must
    be private.
